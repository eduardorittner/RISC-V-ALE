# Progress: Optimize The C++ Core (whisper)

NOTE: This document uses the ASD-STE100 (Simplified Technical English) writing
rules. Code identifiers, file names, metric names and command options are
technical names. They stay in their original form.

This document records the work of `local/optimize-whisper.md`. It gives the
result of each step, the comparison against the estimate of that step, and
each finding that a later step must know.

The instruction is to do the steps 1 to 4 and then to stop.

## Environment

All figures in this document come from one machine and one browser build.

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Operating system | macOS 26.2 (25C56), arm64 |
| Node.js | v26.7.0 |
| Playwright | 1.62.1 (`chromium-1234`) |
| Chromium | Google Chrome for Testing 151.0.7922.34 |
| Native C++ compiler | Apple clang 21.0.0 (clang-2100.1.1.101) |
| Emscripten SDK | 6.0.8 (`aeb67926e7de656da38bc807d83050af93578758`) |
| Branch | `optimize-whisper`, from `645aa31` |

The machine was not idle during the measurements. Other applications used
between 1 and 4 processors. Rule 7 of the plan makes the Rust core the live
control for this reason, and all comparisons between steps use the figures of
one session.

## Prerequisites

The Emscripten SDK was not on the machine. The installation needs Python 3.10
or later, and the Python of the operating system is 3.9.6. A Python 3.12.13
from `uv` solved this:

```sh
uv python install 3.12
export EMSDK_PYTHON=$(uv python find 3.12)
cd $HOME/emsdk && ./emsdk install latest && ./emsdk activate latest
```

The native oracle (`crates/riscv-rs/SweRV-ISS-1/opt/whisper`) and the vendored
Boost library were already built in the working tree.

## Step 1: Add the benchmark harness

**State: complete.**

### What the step added

`scripts/perf-core/` contains the harness. `scripts/perf-core/README.md`
describes each file. The harness follows the properties of section 5 of the
plan, which come from sections 3 and 13 of `local/rs-cpp.md`.

The report does not contain the harness code, so step 1 rebuilt it from the
description. Three parts of the reconstruction needed a decision:

1. **The workload programs.** The report gives the shapes, the encoders
   (`crates/riscv-rs/benches/throughput_benchmarks.rs`) and the exact retired
   counts. The counts are a strong test of the reconstruction, because a
   different setup sequence gives a different count. The generator matches all
   three counts exactly:

   | Workload | Iterations | Setup | Body | Exit | Retired |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | `alu` | 4,000,000 | 2 | 5 | 3 | 20,000,005 |
   | `memcpy` | 2,500,000 | 6 | 8 | 3 | 20,000,009 |
   | `mixed` | 3,333,333 | 2 | 6 | 3 | 20,000,003 |

   The `memcpy` setup is 6 instructions and not the 8 of the Rust benchmark,
   because `SRC_BASE` (`0x100000`) and `DST_BASE` (`0x200000`) are exact `lui`
   immediates. Only this form gives 20,000,009.

2. **The ELF container.** Each program goes into a minimal ELF32 executable
   with one `PT_LOAD` segment and no sections. Both cores read the segment
   table.

3. **The two workers.** The globals that each worker must define come from
   section 13 of the report and from the `EM_JS` shims in `Hart.cpp`,
   `Syscall.cpp` and `Interactive.cpp` for the C++ core, and from
   `crates/riscv-rs/src/host_imports.rs` for the Rust core.

### Validation gate 1: the retired counts

**PASS.** The native oracle, the C++ core in the browser and the Rust core in
the browser all retire the exact counts, on all three workloads and with both
ISA strings.

```
PASS  --isa acdfimsu  alu     retired 20000005   99.5 MIPS native
PASS  --isa acdfimsu  memcpy  retired 20000009   66.7 MIPS native
PASS  --isa acdfimsu  mixed   retired 20000003  102.6 MIPS native
PASS  --isa acdfim    alu     retired 20000005  351.6 MIPS native
PASS  --isa acdfim    memcpy  retired 20000009  155.1 MIPS native
PASS  --isa acdfim    mixed   retired 20000003  247.4 MIPS native
```

### The baseline

Median of 5, MIPS. Headless Chromium. Full data in
`scripts/perf-core/results/step-1-baseline.json`.

| Configuration | `alu` | `memcpy` | `mixed` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rust (the control) | 202.2 | 201.6 | 261.1 |
| C++ `--isa acdfimsu` (as shipped) | 35.8 | 31.6 | 35.3 |
| C++ `--isa acdfim` | 136.1 | 90.5 | 178.6 |

Best of 5, MIPS.

| Configuration | `alu` | `memcpy` | `mixed` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rust (the control) | 205.8 | 202.8 | 263.5 |
| C++ `--isa acdfimsu` (as shipped) | 35.8 | 32.4 | 35.6 |
| C++ `--isa acdfim` | 137.0 | 90.5 | 180.2 |

### Validation gate 2: agreement with section 4.1 of the report

The gate compares the Rust control and the C++ `--isa acdfimsu` figures
against the report. The tolerance is 15% (section 8 of the plan).

| Cell | Measured | Report | Difference | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rust `alu` | 202.2 | 222.5 | −9.1% | PASS |
| Rust `memcpy` | 201.6 | 188.5 | +7.0% | PASS |
| Rust `mixed` | 261.1 | 244.5 | +6.8% | PASS |
| C++ `acdfimsu` `alu` | 35.8 | 35.0 | +2.3% | PASS |
| C++ `acdfimsu` `memcpy` | 31.6 | 25.0 | +26.4% | FAIL |
| C++ `acdfimsu` `mixed` | 35.3 | 28.2 | +25.2% | FAIL |

**Four of the six cells pass. Two do not.** Both failures are in the
direction that makes the C++ core look better than the report says, so they
raise the baseline and make the estimated speedup of step 2 more difficult to
reach. They do not flatter the plan.

The cause is not the same for the two cells:

- **`memcpy`.** The difference is also in the native figures, where the binary
  is the same binary the report used: 155.1 MIPS against 98.6 MIPS with
  `--isa acdfim`, and 66.7 against 58.8 with `--isa acdfimsu`. A difference
  that is present natively cannot come from the browser or from the workers.
  The `memcpy` program of this harness is therefore not byte-for-byte the
  `memcpy` program of the report, although it retires the exact count that the
  report records. The most probable difference is the address pattern of the
  loads and the stores.
- **`mixed`.** The native figures agree (102.6 against 101.1 with
  `--isa acdfimsu`), and the browser `--isa acdfim` figures agree (178.6
  against 173.9). Only the browser `--isa acdfimsu` cell differs. Section 12
  of the report records that the C++ browser samples spread by up to 33%, so
  one noisy sample in the report is a sufficient explanation.

**Decision.** The harness is fit for the plan. Every comparison in the plan is
between two steps of one session, and the Rust control agrees with the report
in all three workloads. The two cells that differ are recorded here so that a
later reader does not compare a figure of this document against the report
without this note.

### Finding: the two cores do not tier up in the same way

This finding changes how the harness must run, and any future measurement of
either core must know it.

V8 compiles a WebAssembly function with the baseline tier (Liftoff) on the
first call, and with the optimizing tier after that. It does not replace the
code of a call that is already in progress.

- The Rust core does all of its work inside one large `run_slice` function.
  The first call runs in the baseline tier from start to end. Measured, on
  `alu`: 133.2 MIPS on the first call, then 224.2, 225.5, 225.5, 225.2 and
  224.2 MIPS on the calls after it. The optimized figure is the figure the
  application delivers, because the application calls `run_slice` one time for
  each slice of a `setTimeout` chain.
- The C++ core runs its whole program inside one `main` call, and its module
  is one-shot. Its inner loop calls many small functions millions of times, so
  V8 optimizes those callees while the outer loop runs. Measured with
  `--js-flags=--liftoff-only`: 106.4 / 45.4 / 106.4 MIPS, against 119.0 / 86.2
  / 180.2 MIPS with the default flags. The C++ core therefore reaches its
  optimized speed inside one run.

A first version of this harness made a new worker for each Rust repetition and
reported 129.8 / 122.0 / 161.7 MIPS, which is about 40% below the report. The
harness now keeps one Rust worker for the whole session and makes a new C++
worker for each repetition. Section 13 of the report describes the same
arrangement ("The C++ module is one-shot ... Start a new worker for each
repetition"), and it is what each core does in the application.

### Functional checks

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Retired counts | PASS. Exact on all three workloads, both cores, both ISA strings. |
| 2. The application | Not applicable. Step 1 adds new files only and changes no application file. |
| 3. MMIO | Not applicable. No application file changed. |
| 4. Interrupts | Not applicable. No application file changed. |
